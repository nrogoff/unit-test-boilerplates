# unit-test-boilerplates
This project is a personal sample that incororates what I consider the best and most comprehensive set of tools, libraries and techniques to build mature platforms and systems.

These include
- Code First Entity Framework with Migrations
- xUnit unit tests that incorporate realistic synthetic data in SQL database tests
- Azure Function API's with paging, OData, Open API specs, Heath status reporting, Application Insights and more.
- IoC and depedency injection

The sample projects are based around the Azure SQL Sample Database. This illustrates some relational data concepts and testing.
